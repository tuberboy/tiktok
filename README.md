# TikTok Account Management & Automation

This project automates the process of managing TikTok accounts, including actions like account creation, liking posts, following users, and viewing videos. The automation is powered by various algorithms like X-Ladon, X-Argus, X-Gorgon, X-Khronos, and others for enhanced functionality and bypassing detection.

## Features

- **Create TikTok Account**: Automatically creates a new TikTok account with required details.
- **Like Posts**: Automates the liking of TikTok posts.
- **Follow Users**: Allows automated following of users.
- **View Videos**: Simulates video views for engagement.
- **Algorithm Integration**: Uses advanced algorithms (X-Ladon, X-Argus, X-Gorgon, X-Khronos, etc.) to ensure safe and realistic interactions.
  - **X-Ladon**: An algorithm used for bypassing rate limits and avoiding detection when performing actions.
  - **X-Argus**: Detects patterns and adjusts interactions to avoid detection by TikTok's anti-bot system.
  - **X-Gorgon**: A powerful algorithm to handle TikTokâ€™s encryption and security protocols for requests.
  - **X-Khronos**: Used for time-based actions to simulate human-like behavior and reduce suspicion.
